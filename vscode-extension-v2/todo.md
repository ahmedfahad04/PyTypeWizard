## Issues

1. Whenever editor loads for the first time it takes a good amount of time to show the error list in sidebar.
   Then when I switch tab and get back to the pytypewizard tab it again start to load BUT it keeps on going. However if
   we press ctrl+s then it saves and the errors are visible. Need to fix it
