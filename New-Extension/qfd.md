# About this tool

## Issues

1. **Type Inconsistency**: Wrong annotations cause crashes when unexpected data types are used.
2. **Hidden Bugs**: Incorrect annotations prevent early detection of type errors, leading to runtime failures.
3. **Harder Debugging**: Misleading types make tracking the source of bugs more difficult.

## Resolve

1. **Type Inconsistency**: PyTypeWizard detects mismatches and auto-corrects annotations in real-time.
2. **Hidden Bugs**: PyTypeWizard catches potential runtime type errors early by analyzing code context.
3. **Harder Debugging**: It simplifies debugging by providing clear explanations and suggested fixes.

This version removes redundant points and highlights key issues and resolutions.

## Issues

1. **Type Inconsistency**:  
   _Issue_: A function is annotated to return a `str`, but it sometimes returns an `int`, causing crashes.

   ```python
   def process_data() -> str:
       return 123  # This causes a crash later when a string is expected.
   ```

2. **Hidden Bugs**:  
   _Issue_: A type annotation is wrong, allowing invalid data to pass unchecked until a runtime failure.

   ```python
   def calculate_total(price: float, quantity: int) -> float:
       return price * quantity  # Quantity is sometimes passed as a float, causing issues later.
   ```

3. **Harder Debugging**:  
   _Issue_: Misleading annotations lead to harder debugging because they donâ€™t reflect actual usage, making bug tracing difficult.
   ```python
   def add_to_list(item: str, items: list[str]) -> list[str]:
       items.append(item)
       return items  # The code breaks later when a non-string type is passed, despite the annotation.
   ```

## Resolve

1. **Type Inconsistency**:  
   _Solution_: PyTypeWizard detects the mismatch and suggests changing the return type to handle multiple types.

   ```python
   def process_data() -> str | int:
       return 123  # PyTypeWizard updates annotation to handle both types.
   ```

2. **Hidden Bugs**:  
   _Solution_: PyTypeWizard catches this during code analysis and recommends a fix to prevent runtime issues.

   ```python
   def calculate_total(price: float, quantity: int | float) -> float:
       return price * quantity  # Adjusted type hints for flexibility, avoiding runtime errors.
   ```

3. **Harder Debugging**:  
   _Solution_: PyTypeWizard provides a clear explanation and suggests correct annotations, making debugging simpler.
   ```python
   def add_to_list(item: Any, items: list[Any]) -> list[Any]:
       items.append(item)
       return items  # PyTypeWizard identifies the mismatch and corrects annotations.
   ```

These examples demonstrate how PyTypeWizard improves code reliability and debugging by resolving type-related issues.
