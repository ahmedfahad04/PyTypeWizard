**Core Modules:**

* **HelpPanel:**  This module likely handles the generation and display of help panels or documentation for the project.  
    * **create_parameter_help_panel:**  A function within HelpPanel that likely creates a help panel specifically for parameters.
    * **format_command_entries:**  A function within HelpPanel that likely formats entries for commands within the help panel.
    * **format_doc:**  A function within HelpPanel that likely formats documentation for display within the help panel.

**Submodules:**

* **config:**  This submodule likely deals with configuration management, potentially loading and parsing configuration files.
* **convert:**  This submodule likely handles conversions between different data types or formats.
* **default_name_transform:**  This submodule likely defines a function or set of functions for transforming names (possibly for variables or parameters) according to default rules.
* **env_var_split:**  This submodule likely handles splitting environment variables into key-value pairs.
* **types:**  This submodule likely defines or manages data types used within the project. 

**Project Overview:**

The project seems to focus on providing a framework for managing configuration, potentially including features like:

* **Command-line interface:**  The presence of help panel functions suggests a CLI interface.
* **Configuration loading and parsing:** The "config" submodule implies handling of configuration files.
* **Data type management:** The "types" submodule suggests a focus on defining and managing data types used in the project.
* **Environment variable handling:** The "env_var_split" submodule suggests support for reading and processing environment variables.
