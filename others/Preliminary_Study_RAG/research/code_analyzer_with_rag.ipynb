    "## Chunking\n",
    "\n",
    "In RAG systems, “chunking” refers to the segmentation of input text into shorter and more meaningful units. This enables the system to efficiently pinpoint and retrieve relevant pieces of information. The quality of chunks are **essential** to how effective your system will be.\n",
    "\n",
    "The most **important** thing to consider when **deciding a chunking strategy** is the structure of the documents that you are loading into your vector database. If the documents contain similar-length paragraphs, it would be useful to consider this when determining the size of the chunk.\n",
    "\n",
    "----\n",
    "\n",
    "If your `chunk_size` is too large, then you will be inputing a lot of noisy and unwanted context to the final LLM query. Further, as LLMs are limited by their context window size, the larger the chunk, the fewer pieces of relevant information you can include as context to your query.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `chunk_overlap` refers to intentionally duplicating tokens at the beginning and end of each adjacent chunk. This helps retain additional context from neighbouring chunks which can improve the quality of the information passed into the prompt.\n",
    "\n",
    "When deploying these systems to real-world applications, it is important to plot distributions of text lengths in your data, and tune these parameters based on experimentation of parameters such as `chunk_size` and `chunk_overlap`."
